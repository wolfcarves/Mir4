                Talking about the website's performace I am fully aware that the site functions a little bit slower
                especially when you're using it on mobile. But if that is the case then you can turn off animation by
                disabling effects in settings (as shown below). This would help to reduce memory usage.

                If you ever found a bug and wanted to report it you can email me here at <a href="#" class="email">rodelcrisosto@gmail.com</a>. 
                State how to trigger those bug and provide which browser and device you are using.
                It would be better if you add media either an image or video. This will help me fix bugs and improve the website.
